# My Script Repository

This repository contains a collection of random scripts I've written. They cover a variety of topics and languages, and are primarily for my own use and learning. However, they're open to anyone who might find them useful.

## Contents

The scripts in this repository are usually single-file scripts. Scripts with dependencies with have their own folder in this repo. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

- `d-backup`: A simple backup script for personal use.
- `d-cinema`: A script to turn off my side screen when watching movies.
- `d-ps5-loopback`: A script to enable the loopback module for PulseAudio to stream audio from my PS5 to my PC.

... and so on. Each directory will contain its own README with more information about the scripts within.

## Usage

You may use these scripts as you see fit, but at your own risk. I make no guarantees about their functionality or safety. They are personalized for my own use and may not function as you expect.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my own use, I'm open to contributions and suggestions. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have something to add.

## License
